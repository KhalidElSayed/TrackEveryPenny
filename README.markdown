Track Every Penny
=================

Welcome to the codebase from the book [*Responsible Design
in Android, Part 1: Dancing with the SDK*](http://leanpub.com/ResponsibleDesignAndroid-Part1).
You can follow along with the book and try out the code
for yourself.

## How to read along with the book

I've labeled each code sample with a tag that looks like
`snap_nn`, where `nn` is a number. In an homage to BASIC,
I've numbered the "snaps" (or *snapshots*) starting at 10
and in increments of 10, just in case I have to insert a
code sample between two others.

If you want to explore the code at any point of the book,
then look for the snapshot number in a code sample--say
120--and check out tag `snap_120`.

## Toolset

Here is my development environment, which you can try to match,
if you like:

* Mac OS 10.8.2
* zsh 4.3.11
* IDEA 11.1.5 running on Apple's JVM 1.6.0_37
* git 1.8.0.1
* Android SDK Manager 20.0.3

I don't know whether any of these versions affects the app's
ability to run. I suspect not.

I have not imported this code into Eclipse nor any other
IDE, so for now, if you want to do that, you're on your own.
If you have any trouble, then that might point to a dependency
problem that I want to fix, so feel free to tell me.
