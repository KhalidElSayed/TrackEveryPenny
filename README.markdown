Track Every Penny
=================

Welcome to the codebase from the book [*Responsible Design
in Android, Part 1: Dancing with the SDK*](http://leanpub.com/ResponsibleDesignAndroid-Part1).
You can follow along with the book and try out the code
for yourself.

## How to read along with the book

Before introducing a group of code samples, I've indicated
which "snapshot" the code comes from. I've labeled these
snapshots in increments of 10, just like we did with line
numbers in BASIC, just in case I need to insert a code
sample between two others. The code just following the
heading "Snapshot 120" corresponds to the tag `snapshot_120`
in this repository.

## Toolset

Here is my development environment, which you can try to match,
if you like:

* Mac OS 10.8.2
* zsh 4.3.11
* IDEA 11.1.5 running on Apple's JVM 1.6.0_37
* git 1.8.0.1
* Android SDK Manager 20.0.3

I don't know whether any of these versions affects the app's
ability to run. I suspect not.

I have not imported this code into Eclipse nor any other
IDE, so for now, if you want to do that, you're on your own.
If you have any trouble, then that might point to a dependency
problem that I want to fix, so feel free to tell me.
